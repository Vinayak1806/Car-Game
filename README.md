# Car Racing Game
<i>The project is about developing a Car Racing Game in a Microsoft Visual Studio (VB.NET) </i><br>

<p>Developing a car racing game in VB.NET allows you to create a dynamic and interactive 
gaming experience for players. Use VB.NET as the primary programming language for 
developing the game logic, user interface, and game mechanics. Design the game to provide 
a realistic racing experience with detailed car physics, responsive controls, and immersive graphics.</p>

<p>In this game user can use the movement keys to control a car and make high score. 
  When score increases then speed of car also increases.This provides better experience to user. Games have an overhead view showing all cars and the track, a third-person view showing their car and nearby cars  </p><br>
